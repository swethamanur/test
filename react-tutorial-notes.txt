*React is installed using npm create-react-app appname
*Index.html is the main file that is loaded where the App componenet is embedded in the root div.
*IN App.js
App class is a class component and there is always one life cycle method called render used which returns jsx code.

* Jsx is bascially embedded javascript within html.
*It is done bec doing using react is very diffocult and a lot of effort.

*css is same as html but it is camelcasing here.

*.map is a high  order method that takes in an array and tranfroms it and returns an array with jsx in t.

import PropTypes  from 'prop-types';
to validtae the prop data types

*Note:
We cannot use normal function es5 in class components because these user defined functions do not know what 'this' is and is undefinde. We can solve it by using the bind(this ) method.

Else we can use arrow functions as it binds this to the current object and knows what this is.

Also, the life cycle methods like render(), componenetDidMount() bind this and know this because they are part of the React.Componenet

*We need to always climp the ladder up to the App component where the state is defined.

*Note:
For bootstrap in react:
$ npm install --save react react-dom
$ npm install --save react-bootstrap
then import what you really need from the bootstrap like :

import Button from 'react-bootstrap/lib/Button';


Note:
React.Fragment is again a tag that can be used to wrap React elements intoone component.
